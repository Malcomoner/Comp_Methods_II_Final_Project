# Comp_Methods_II_Final_Project
In this project, we looked at the effect qualified immunity had on the number of police shooting deaths in nine various states. We looked at the three states that removed qualified immunity for state constitutional violations and included three blue and red states to limit the effect of bias. 

Finally, should you not have the data sets, we provided the code in the Juypter Notebook so that you can download the CSVs, convert them to pandas dataframes, and clean the data. You can then run the same code we did to produce the same outputs.
